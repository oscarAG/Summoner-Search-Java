# Summoner-Search
Summoner Search is a Java desktop application that receives information about a player from the official Riot API.
When the application starts, just type in a League of Legends username, select the region that the player belongs to, and click search. 
The application will return information regarding the player. The project uses my personal API Key to receive information. However, anyone
using this project for their own use should use their own personal API key. A personal API key can be created by 
registering at [Riot's developer page](https://developer.riotgames.com/). To create a developer account you must have a League of Legends account, 
which can be created [here](https://login.leagueoflegends.com/?region=na&lang=en_US&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fna.leagueoflegends.com%2Fen%2F).This application needs the the [JSON-Java](http://www.json.org/java/) library 
to function. The .jar file can be downloaded [here](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavajsonjar.htm). 

This project can be used, copied, modified, and distributed in any way. At any time I reserve the right to change my API key, thus making
this application unusable for anyone who does not input their own API key. The API variable can be found under the LoLSearch class.
